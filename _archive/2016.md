  Burdens. Criticism. Anxiety.
  </p>
  <p>
  The Apostle Paul describes facing all of these as a result of his commitment to proclaiming the Gospel. Yet, through it all, he was able to testify that he did not lose heart and likewise commends those who "have the same spirit of faith" to do the same by looking to things that are unseen and eternal (2 Cor. 4).

  <p>
  Drawing from Paul's model of praying, preaching, and perseverance, Alistair Begg, along with guests Josh Moody, Senior Pastor at College Church in Wheaton, Illinois, D.A. Carson from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois, and Jonathan Holmes from Parkside Church, look to Paul's example of ministry as a model for encouragement during the 2016 Basics Conference.

sessions:
- title: We Do Not Lose Heart, Part One
  speakers: [Alistair-Begg]
  scripture: 
  description: | 
    Though he faced significant opposition throughout his life and ministry, the Apostle Paul was compelled to keep on preaching, working to spread the Gospel even in the most difficult circumstances. Alistair Begg uses Paul's example to encourage today's pastors to rely on God's strength when they feel weak, to seek His grace when disappointments arise, and to take heart in challenges, knowing that God's power is best displayed as He preserves His own in times of trouble.

- title: The Sweep of Praise
  speakers: [DA-Carson]
  scripture: 
  description: | 
    We thank and praise God for His good gifts day by day, and rightly so; but biblical figures also focused their praise on God Himself: His deeds and His character. D.A. Carson leads us through Paul’s great passage on praise in Ephesians 1, drawing our attention to the spiritual blessings that are ours in Christ. Because He has chosen and adopted us, redeemed and forgiven us, shown us His great plan for humanity, and claimed us as His own, our lives should be, as Paul wrote, “to the praise of His glory.”

- title: Rejoicing in the Hope of Glory
  speakers: [Josh-Moody]
  scripture: 
  description: |
    The great joy that the Apostle Paul communicated to his hearers was based not on his own abilities or success, but on the grace and power of God to redeem, justify, and glorify His own. Since Paul’s access to God was fixed forever, he preached and lived with confidence and brave courage. In this session, Josh Moody encourages pastors to act on their belief in the believer’s sure standing in the realm of grace, allowing this great truth to transform their lives and their preaching.

breakouts:
- title: Making the most of your counseling sessions
  speakers: [Jonathan Holmes]
  description: |
    When pastors and leaders meet with individuals and couples for counseling, it can often seem overwhelming.
    What are some of the guiding principles and objectives for pastors and elders as they meet with those under their care?
    When is it good to refer to someone else for care and counsel? How can pastors practically equip their members for counseling ministry?
    Jonathan is the pastor of counseling at Parkside.
