Ministers of Jesus Christ have a high calling which encompasses their personal lives as well as their public ministry.
In this message, Alistair Begg reminds pastors of important points from Paul’s first letter to Timothy. Before gospel
ministers can remind others of the truths of the faith, those same truths must first nourish their own souls.
Then, actively putting these truths into practice, they are to train themselves in godliness as they labor
with God’s help to proclaim the good news of salvation.
