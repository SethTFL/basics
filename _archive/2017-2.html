At its core, expository preaching follows a simple pattern: read the Word of God then explain the text to those listening,
as Ezra and his colleagues did in Nehemiah 8. In this message, Dr. Albert Mohler explains how the secularized culture around
us has made expository preaching vitally important today. When pastors read the Bible and explain the text, they convey
information that is not heard elsewhereâ€”revealed truth in a society that opposes revelation. By following this biblical pattern,
ministers rely on the Holy Spirit to bring souls to Christ and the Lord Jesus gets all the glory.
