    Ministers of Jesus Christ have a high calling which encompasses their personal lives as well as their public ministry.
    In this message, Alistair Begg reminds pastors of important points from Paul’s first letter to Timothy. Before gospel
    ministers can remind others of the truths of the faith, those same truths must first nourish their own souls.
    Then, actively putting these truths into practice, they are to train themselves in godliness as they labor
    with God’s help to proclaim the good news of salvation.

    At its core, expository preaching follows a simple pattern: read the Word of God then explain the text to those listening,
    as Ezra and his colleagues did in Nehemiah 8. In this message, Dr. Albert Mohler explains how the secularized culture around
    us has made expository preaching vitally important today. When pastors read the Bible and explain the text, they convey
    information that is not heard elsewhere—revealed truth in a society that opposes revelation. By following this biblical pattern,
    ministers rely on the Holy Spirit to bring souls to Christ and the Lord Jesus gets all the glory.
- title: Sola Scriptura
  speakers: [Albert-Mohler]
  scripture: 
  description: |
    Sola scriptura—the principle that God speaks only through the Scriptures—was foundational to the Reformation. Dr. Albert Mohler draws helpful insights from Deuteronomy 4,
    emphasizing the wonderful fact that God allows His creatures to hear His voice, and that the God Who spoke to Israel out of the fire still communicates to His people when
    His Word is faithfully preached. Believers need to understand that we are bound by the Word of our Creator Who speaks and reveals Himself not because we deserve it, but because of His great love.

- title: Making the most of your counseling sessions
  speakers: [Jonathan Holmes]
  description: |
    When pastors and leaders meet with individuals and couples for counseling, it can often seem overwhelming.
    What are some of the guiding principles and objectives for pastors and elders as they meet with those under their care?
    When is it good to refer to someone else for care and counsel? How can pastors practically equip their members for counseling ministry?
    Jonathan is the pastor of counseling at Parkside.
